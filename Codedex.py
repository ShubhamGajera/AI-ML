#06 data types
# 06. Data Types
# # Variables
# In programming, variables are used for storing data values. Each variable has a name and holds a value. 📦



# The variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and the _ underscore.

# These are all valid variable names and values:

# name = 'Erlich Bachman'
# user_id = 16180339887
# progress = 0.75
# xp = 60
# verified = True

# The = equal sign means assignment:

# We're assigning the string value 'Erlich Bachman' to the variable name.
# We're assigning the number value 16180339887 to the variable user_id.
# We're assigning the number value 0.75 to the variable progress.
# We're assigning the number value 60 to the variable xp.
# We're assigning the truth value True to the variable verified.
# We can also change the value of a variable, or print it out:

# xp = 70
# xp = 80

# print(xp)    # Output: 80

# Here, we are assigning the number value 70 to the variable xp. Then, we are reassigning the number value 80 to the same variable. And printing it out.

# # Data Types
# ## Integer
# An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains the number 0, positive and negative counting numbers. If we were counting the number of people on the bus or the number of jellybeans in a jar, we would use an integer.

# year = 2023
# age = 32

# ## Float
# A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractions or precise measurements. If you were measuring the length and width of the couch, calculating the test score percentage, or storing a baseball player’s batting average, we would use a float instead of an int.

# pi = 3.14159
# meal_cost = 12.99

# ## String
# A string, or str, is used for storing text. Strings are wrapped in double quotes " " or single quotes ' '.

# message = "good nite"
# username = '@snoopdogg'

# When we did printing in the first chapter, we printed a string data type.

# ## Boolean
# A Boolean data type, or bool, stores a value that can only be either true or false. In Python, it's capitalized True or False. It's named after the British mathematician George Boole (1815-1864).

# late_to_class = False
# cranky = True

# Woohoo! You learned variables in Python! 🙌

# Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

# Data types: int, float, str, bool.
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
# The % modulo finds the remainder.
# The ** exponentiation finds the exponent.
# The input() function is used to get user input.
# The int() function converts a value into an integer number.
# Let's put it all together now!

# Write code below 💖

# Relational Operators
# A lot of the times inside conditions, we are comparing two values. To do so, we 
# need to use a different type of operators called relational operators that compares values:
# == equal to
# != not equal to
# > greater than
# < less than
# >= greater than or equal to
# <= less than or equal to

# Logical Operators
# One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

# Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. They are and, or, and not operators:

# and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
# or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
# not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.
# Here are some examples:

# Write code below 💖

height = int(input("Height : "))
credits = int(input("Credits : "))

if height>=137 and credits >= 10:
  print("Enjoy the ride!")
elif credits >= 10:
  print("You are not tall enough to ride.")
elif height>=137:
  print("You don't have enough credits.")
else:
  print("Not met either requirement.")
